To demonstrate CSRF(cross-site request forgery) attack in Local, 
there are 2 frontend projects, one simulating Bank site(csrf-bank-ui/csrf-bank) and the other one simulating Attacker site(scrf-bank-ui/csrf-attacker-site).

You can run these projects with differents ports with the commande exemple below
```
ng serve --port 4300
```

There are no sign in UI neither bank account related UI so you need to initialize yourself with DML script.
